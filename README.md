Hi there! I'm **Om Singh**, a passionate and curious **Computer Science Engineering student (2nd Year)** who loves building cool and useful web projects 💻.

🔧 I'm currently learning and working with:
- **Frontend Development** using **React**, **Vite**, **java Script**, and **Tailwind CSS**
- UI frameworks like **ShadCN UI**
- APIs & Full-Stack concepts (experimenting with **Firebase**, **Supabase**, and AI tools like **Claude API** & **OpenAI**)

📚 Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:

🚀 Always exploring new ideas, solving problems, and aiming to build projects that are both smart and simple.
